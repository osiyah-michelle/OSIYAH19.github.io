    <p>My name is michelle osiyah. i was born and raised in Nairobi,Kenya</p>
    <br> I am in the ischool and my major is Information management and Technology</br>    
    <br>i love doing stress free activities. i love to swim go for random bike rideds and
     make random purchases and have your financial advisor call you, asking if you are okay. 
     usually fun by the way</br>
    <br>i love adventure. i mean trying to find out new stuff everyday, 
    being curious obut catiously. i hate alcohol so alcohol related fun based activities 
    are not my thing. </br>
    <p>i am excited for next semester. i got an opportunity 
        to participate in the spring Break in silicon valley</p>
    <br>i did the 2 day roadtrip to philadelphia and it was amazing. 
    so amaizing. so i cant wait for the next opportunity to delve into the 
    career path and really get immersed into the bussiness side of the ischool</br>
